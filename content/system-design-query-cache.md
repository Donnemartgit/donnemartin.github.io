# Design a key-value cache to save the results of the most recent web server queries

*Note: This document links directly to relevant areas found in the [system design topics](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#index-of-system-design-topics) to avoid duplication.  Refer to the linked content for general talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives.*

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

> Gather requirements and scope the problem.
> Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.
> Discuss assumptions.

Without an interviewer to address clarifying questions, we'll define some use cases and constraints.

### Use cases

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases

* **User** sends a search request resulting in a cache hit
* **User** sends a search request resulting in a cache miss
* **Service** has high availability

### Constraints and assumptions

#### State assumptions

* Traffic is not evenly distributed
    * Popular queries should almost always be in the cache
    * Need to determine how to expire/refresh
* Serving from cache requires fast lookups
* Low latency between machines
* Limited memory in cache
    * Need to determine what to keep/remove
    * Need to cache millions of queries
* 10 million users
* 10 billion queries per month

#### Calculate usage

**Clarify with your interviewer if you should run back-of-the-envelope usage calculations.**

* Cache stores ordered list of key: query, value: results
    * `query` - 50 bytes
    * `title` - 20 bytes
    * `snippet` - 200 bytes
    * Total: 270 bytes
* 2.7 TB of cache data per month if all 10 billion queries are unique and all are stored
    * 270 bytes per search * 10 billion searches per month
    * Assumptions state limited memory, need to determine how to expire contents
* 4,000 requests per second

Handy conversion guide:

* 2.5 million seconds per month
* 1 request per second = 2.5 million requests per month
* 40 requests per second = 100 million requests per month
* 400 requests per second = 1 billion requests per month

## Step 3: Design core components

> Dive into details for each core component.

### Use case: User sends a request resulting in a cache hit

Popular queries can be served from a **Memory Cache** such as Redis or Memcached to reduce read latency and to avoid overloading the **Reverse Index Service** and **Document Service**.  Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.<sup><a href=https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know>1</a></sup>

Since the cache has limited capacity, we'll use a least recently used (LRU) approach to expire older entries.

* The **Client** sends a request to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#reverse-proxy-web-server)
* The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Query API** server
* The **Query API** server does the following:
    * Parses the query
        * Removes markup
        * Breaks up the text into terms
        * Fixes typos
        * Normalizes capitalization
        * Converts the query to use boolean operations
    * Checks the **Memory Cache** for the content matching the query
        * If there's a hit in the **Memory Cache**, the **Memory Cache** does the following:
            * Updates the cached entry's position to the front of the LRU list
            * Returns the cached contents
        * Else, the **Query API** does the following:
            * Uses the **Reverse Index Service** to find documents matching the query
                * The **Reverse Index Service** ranks the matching results and returns the top ones
            * Uses the **Document Service** to return titles and snippets
            * Updates the **Memory Cache** with the contents, placing the entry at the front of the LRU list

#### Cache implementation

The cache can use a doubly-linked list: new items will be added to the head while items to expire will be removed from the tail.  We'll use a hash table for fast lookups to each linked list node.

**Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.

**Query API Server** implementation:

```python
class QueryApi(object):

    def __init__(self, memory_cache, reverse_index_service):
        self.memory_cache = memory_cache
        self.reverse_index_service = reverse_index_service

    def parse_query(self, query):
        """Remove markup, break text into terms, deal with typos,
        normalize capitalization, convert to use boolean operations.
        """
        ...

    def process_query(self, query):
        query = self.parse_query(query)
        results = self.memory_cache.get(query)
        if results is None:
            results = self.reverse_index_service.process_search(query)
            self.memory_cache.set(query, results)
        return results
```

**Node** implementation:

```python
class Node(object):

    def __init__(self, query, results):
        self.query = query
        self.results = results
```

**LinkedList** implementation:

```python
class LinkedList(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def move_to_front(self, node):
        ...

    def append_to_front(self, node):
        ...

    def remove_from_tail(self):
        ...
```
