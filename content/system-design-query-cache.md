# Design a key-value cache to save the results of the most recent web server queries

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

> Gather requirements and scope the problem.
> Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.
> Discuss assumptions.

Without an interviewer to address clarifying questions, we'll define some use cases and constraints.

### Use cases

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases

* **User** sends a search request resulting in a cache hit
* **User** sends a search request resulting in a cache miss
* **Service** has high availability

### Constraints and assumptions

#### State assumptions

* Traffic is not evenly distributed
    * Popular queries should almost always be in the cache
    * Need to determine how to expire/refresh
* Serving from cache requires fast lookups
* Low latency between machines
* Limited memory in cache
    * Need to determine what to keep/remove
    * Need to cache millions of queries
* 10 million users
* 10 billion queries per month
