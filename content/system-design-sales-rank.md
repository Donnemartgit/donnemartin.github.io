# Design Amazon's sales rank by category feature

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

> Gather requirements and scope the problem.
> Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.
> Discuss assumptions.

Without an interviewer to address clarifying questions, we'll define some use cases and constraints.

### Use cases

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use case

* **Service** calculates the past week's most popular products by category
* **User** views the past week's most popular products by category
* **Service** has high availability

#### Out of scope

* The general e-commerce site
    * Design components only for calculating sales rank

### Constraints and assumptions

#### State assumptions

* Traffic is not evenly distributed
* Items can be in multiple categories
* Items cannot change categories
* There are no subcategories ie `foo/bar/baz`
* Results must be updated hourly
    * More popular products might need to be updated more frequently
* 10 million products
* 1000 categories
* 1 billion transactions per month
* 100 billion read requests per month
* 100:1 read to write ratio

#### Calculate usage

**Clarify with your interviewer if you should run back-of-the-envelope usage calculations.**

* Size per transaction:
    * `created_at` - 5 bytes
    * `product_id` - 8 bytes
    * `category_id` - 4 bytes
    * `seller_id` - 8 bytes
    * `buyer_id` - 8 bytes
    * `quantity` - 4 bytes
    * `total_price` - 5 bytes
    * Total: ~40 bytes
* 40 GB of new transaction content per month
    * 40 bytes per transaction * 1 billion transactions per month
    * 1.44 TB of new transaction content in 3 years
    * Assume most are new transactions instead of updates to existing ones
* 400 transactions per second on average
* 40,000 read requests per second on average
