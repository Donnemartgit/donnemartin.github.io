## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

> Gather requirements and scope the problem.
> Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.
> Discuss assumptions.

Without an interviewer to address clarifying questions, we'll define some use cases and constraints.

### Use cases

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases

* **User** searches for someone and sees the shortest path to the searched person
* **Service** has high availability

### Constraints and assumptions

#### State assumptions

* Traffic is not evenly distributed
    * Some searches are more popular than others, while others are only executed once
* Graph data won't fit on a single machine
* Graph edges are unweighted
* 100 million users
* 50 friends per user average
* 1 billion friend searches per month

Exercise the use of more traditional systems - don't use graph-specific solutions such as [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) or a graph database like [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)

#### Calculate usage

**Clarify with your interviewer if you should run back-of-the-envelope usage calculations.**

* 5 billion friend relationships
    * 100 million users * 50 friends per user average
* 400 search requests per second

Handy conversion guide:

* 2.5 million seconds per month
* 1 request per second = 2.5 million requests per month
* 40 requests per second = 100 million requests per month
* 400 requests per second = 1 billion requests per month
