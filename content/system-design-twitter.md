**Design the Facebook feed** and **Design Facebook search** are similar questions.

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

> Gather requirements and scope the problem.
> Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.
> Discuss assumptions.

Without an interviewer to address clarifying questions, we'll define some use cases and constraints.

### Use cases

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases

* **User** posts a tweet
    * **Service** pushes tweets to followers, sending push notifications and emails
* **User** views the user timeline (activity from the user)
* **User** views the home timeline (activity from people the user is following)
* **User** searches keywords
* **Service** has high availability

#### Out of scope

* **Service** pushes tweets to the Twitter Firehose and other streams
* **Service** strips out tweets based on users' visibility settings
    * Hide @reply if the user is not also following the person being replied to
    * Respect 'hide retweets' setting
* Analytics
